# Vue + Axios Template
Example template for fast prototyping using Vue.js and the Axios package. It integrates the [yes/no API](https://yesno.wtf/) to
showcase the use of axios and Vue's basic features.

[VueJs](https://vuejs.org/) is a great javascript framework, which is easy to use, especially if you know some HTML, CSS and Javascript. [Axios]( https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) is a promised based HTTP request package, which simplifies HTTP requests in Javascript. Axios makes consumming APIs super easy.

If you don't know anything about promises or asynchronous javascript check out the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).
